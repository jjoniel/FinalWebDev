		<h3>Amazing Story</h3>

		<p><img src="./img/{{pet}}.jpg" alt="{{pet}}">	
			Once upon a time there was this person named {{name}}. What I find so interesting about them is that they were born in {{place}}. If you look carefully at this page, you might notice a picture of {{name}}'s favorite animal, {{pet}}s. {{name}}'s favorite color is {{color}}, which is also the color of this text. They love cars such as {{car}}s.
